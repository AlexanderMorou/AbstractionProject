Were it not for the differences between the various type-members, there would 
be no need to have a struct method, class method, et cetera.

Struct (ValueType) methods cannot be virtual (as they cannot be derived from).
Interface methods are signature only, and have no accessibility flags defined.
Enum fields do not have complex initializers, and cannot be of any type other
than a primitive numeric value.
